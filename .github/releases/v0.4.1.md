This release introduces the following:

- Fixes an issue where non-URL safe characters were being added to sha256 sums (including '/' and '+').  If multiple '/' were present at the beginning of the object key, CloudFormation would be denied access to the object.
- Upgrades the project to use .NET SDK 5.0.101 and MSBuild 16.8.
